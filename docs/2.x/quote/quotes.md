# Quotes

**Quotes** in the context of Customer Relationship Management (CRM), typically refer to formal proposals or estimates provided to potential customers outlining the products or services offered, along with their associated prices. 

These quotes serve as documented offers, detailing the terms and conditions of a potential sale. They often include itemized lists of products or services, quantities, pricing information, payment terms, and any applicable discounts or taxes.
