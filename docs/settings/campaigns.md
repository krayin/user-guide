# Campaigns

In Krayin CRM, **Campaigns** are structured marketing or communication activities that are linked to events. They are designed to promote, inform, or follow up with leads and contacts using selected email templates.

Campaigns allow CRM users to send personalized messages to a group of recipients based on specific events and predefined templates.
